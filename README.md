## Features

* **Multiple Game Modes**:
  * **1 Player (vs AI)**: Face off against a smart AI powered by the Minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning. Capable of planning up to 7 moves ahead, the AI recognizes patterns and delivers a tough challenge. Can you outwit it?
  * **2 Players**: Enjoy a classic two-player match on the same device, perfect for a quick showdown with a friend.
  * **AI vs AI**: Sit back and observe as two AI players compete, showcasing strategic decision-making and intriguing gameplay.

* **Intuitive Interface**: The game features a clean and user-friendly design. The grid displays blue and orange discs on a gray background, while the main menu sports a stylish logo of four discs (two orange, two blue) in a 2x2 arrangement against a white backdrop.

* **Engaging Gameplay**: Drop discs into the grid and watch the action unfold in real time. The interface clearly announces the winner with messages like "AI won!" (or similar), ensuring every game ends with a satisfying conclusion.

## How to Play

1. **Choose Your Mode**: From the main menu, select "1 Player (vs AI)", "2 Players", or "AI vs AI" using the vibrant buttonsâ€”blue for 1 Player, orange for 2 Players, and purple for AI vs AI.

4. **Back to Menu**: Hit the "Back to Menu" button to return to the main screen and start a new game.

## Technical Details
